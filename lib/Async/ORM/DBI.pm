=head1 NAME

Async::ORM::DBI - Database handle for Async::ORM

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $dbh = Async::ORM::DBI->new(dbi => "dbi:SQLite:table.db");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a dbh factory. Returns a new driver instance that is based on
L<Async::ORM::DBI::Abstract>.

It is created so it is easy to write you own database
handle. Existing implementations include wrappers for L<DBI> and
L<AnyEvent::DBI>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

    my $dbh = Async::ORM::DBI->new(dbi => "dbi:SQLite:table.db");

Returns new L<Async::ORM::DBI> instance. By default L<Async::ORM::DBI::Simple>
is used. To change this behavior pass C<driver> option.

    my $dbh = Async::ORM::DBI->new(
        dbi    => "dbi:SQLite:table.db",
        driver => 'Async::ORM::DBI::AnyEvent'
    );
